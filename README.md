This repository is made up of projects which were made on my own time or were part of past school projects. 
These include projects made in python, c++, I will soon feature some made on javascript.
Each project folder contains a README which specifies the dependencies needed for use.
All of my projects are open source and can be used for any purpose. 
If you wish to suggest any changes, tell me where to improve, or anything else,
contact me via email at: gferrigno2002@gmail.com
