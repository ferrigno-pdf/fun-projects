Object Oriented Programming Final Evaluation (Version 1.0.0)

This project was part of an academic evaluation. The contents of these project
are in spanish (academic requirement). C++ concepts like: inheritance, polymorphism,
abstraction, pointers, etc. were applied in this project. 
This projects models a streaming service menu; the user is able to search for 
certain movies and tv series based on certain factors (rating and genre) or
show them all. datosSeries.txt contains names for tv series, while datosVideos.txt
contains episodes and movies. Aside from movies, our program is capable of 
reading from the tv series' file, match them with their episodes and show them to the user.
main.cpp is the main script for running this program. It contains the menu.

The dependencies for running this project are the following:

- C++ (C++98 or later version)

All of the libraries used in this project already come pre-installed with the
specified C++ version.


This project was made in pairs with a fellow computer science student, Marcelo Hern√°ndez Almida.
