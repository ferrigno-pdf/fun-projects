GUI to calculate compound interest (Version 1.0.0)

This GUI has the purpose of calculating coompund interest from user input.
The functionality for calculating the compound interest is stored in a separate
file called: "finance_calculator.py", contained in the same directory. 
For calculating said compound interest,I used the general compound interest formula.

"calculator.py" is the main script for creating the GUI. It contains all the
attributes and a single method for making the GUI object
(frame, labels, entries, etc.). The dependecies needed for running this script
are the following:

- Python (version 3 or higher)
- tkinter

tkinter generally comes pre-installed when installing Python 3. If there is any
trouble involving tkinter, please visit the following URL for directions:

or check your Python version.
